            <p>To my love</p>
            <p>
              Happy 22nd birthday, Jude. On this special day, I wanted to take a
              moment to express how much you mean to me. Your presence in my
              life has brought so much joy and happiness, and I feel incredibly
              lucky to have you by my side. Jude, you are not only beautiful on
              the outside but also on the inside. Your kindness, compassion, and
              loving nature never fail to touch my heart. Every moment spent
              with you feels like a dream come true, and I cherish every second
              we share together. As we celebrate your birthday, I want you to
              know that my love for you grows stronger with each passing day.
              You bring out the best in me, and I am grateful for the love and
              support you give me unconditionally. You are my rock, my partner,
              and my best friend. On this special day, I wish you all the
              happiness, love, and success that life has to offer. May your
              dreams come true, and may this year be filled with unforgettable
              moments and beautiful memories. I will be right by your side,
              cheering you on every step of the way. Happy birthday, my love.
              You deserve all the love and happiness in the world. With all my
              love,
            </p>
